        Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove
        that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric
        vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline
        cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also
        infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla
        believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves
        towards a zero-emission future, the better.
